    <br> <p>So I'm Sanjana and I am a visual designer.
Uh I think um you know, coming from India, like a lot of things about like art and design, it's amazing to come from a place with so much culture that has so much art already.
So I think that's how I fell in love with, like, sort of design and yeah, um that's a bit about me. Is there anything I could add on? I think that's good. That's amazing.</div>

    </style><h3 class="Blink1"> Second question was, which entry phase are you going to be talking about today?</h3></div>
<br> <p class="Blink2">today I'll be talking about this app called Dexcom Um so a little bit to add on about myself, I'm a Type one diabetic um type one diabetes is an autoimmune disease that happened to Children.
Um there's no particular cause as to why this happens or why it comes about to anyone.
Um so the reason why I'm going to be talking about this app or like why I'm talking about this app?
Uh is that it's something that I use every single day.
And like, I don't know, like it's just always there on my phone.
Um so yeah, this is the app I'm gonna be talking about. I see.</div>
</div>


<div class="e3"> <img src="Group 15.png" > 
    <div class="hide3"> <div class="h3"> <h3>And like why did you choose this app? Like you interface? 
        Like you kind of explained it. Why, but what makes it special for you?</h3></div> 
    <br> Well, I think the reason also why I chose this interface is that there are there are so many different apps catering to the same thing, like the different brands.
    But um I'm also trying to like, this is the first time I'm using it as well because I'm I shifted to this app once I came to new york.
    Um So I think that's um that's probably why I chose to talk about this interface because I'm also so new to it and like it's it's been a little uh exploratory phase for me in terms of like figuring it out.
    I think what makes this particular app special apart from like the other ones is probably because that I think it's um it's just the way it works.
    Like there are okay, so um there are a lot of technical things that go behind this app, right?
    It usually works with an external um instrument that you usually wear and that's like sort of connected via bluetooth on your phone.
    And that's how the app works or how it tracks your um glucose trends.
    And it also alerts you etcetera.
    Um But I think it's so advanced compared to like the other apps that already exist in the market.
    Um I think that's what makes it like super special. Mm I see.</div>

    </style><h3 class="Blink1"> And what was your first impression about the interface?</h3></div> 
    <br>  <p class="Blink2"> I think the simplest city of like comprehension was my first um impression of it because a lot of times it gets super hard for like you to understand what's happening.
    Mainly because it's it's so technologically advanced that it might not come off.
    It might not be easy to comprehend comprehend a lot of times, right?
    Mainly from like the like the country come from like India.
    Um A lot of people have so much stigma around this disease itself.
    Like it's like a lot of people are not aware of it.
    There's like it's so I think when it comes to that, I think you need to have a lot of like knowledge already about it to understand what's happening.
    But I think the way the interface like sort of makes it super simple for you to comprehend it is what makes like I think that's that was my first impression.</div>
</div>


<div class="e5"> <img src="Group 13.png" > 
    <div class="hide5"> <div class="h5"> <h3>See and what do you like and dislike about this interface?</h3></div> 
    <br> Um I think something that I really like is like I was mentioning before, it's I think just even for someone who's using this for the first time or like um interacting with this for the first time, it's so difficult for you to figure out how to set it up or like how to use it.
    So I think the app does a great job of like explaining even that there are so many explainer videos just when you open the phone like to set up your device, it starts explaining you like how you should even set it up on like, like the external device itself, how you're supposed to set up that and how you're supposed to connect that to your phone and then you're up and how it tracks the data.
    Um So I think I really that's like one thing that I really like about the app that it's like super hand holding, which is nice for people like who are using it for the first time.
    Um Another thing that I also really like about the app is this concept of calibration, so what calibration means is that um for for complicated systems like this to like be accurate.
    Um It takes you to do a system calibration, it means that um I'm pretty sure like you have seen like people use a glucose meter right?
    Like where you um where you like get a drop of blood from your hand and then put it into the into the machine and then it shows you what your glucose level is at.
    I don't know if you've interacted with one of those before or like seen it before.
    Yeah, so basically you're supposed to do that and like you're supposed to like whatever number comes on the on that system you're supposed to input like input that onto your phone and make sure you calibrated.
    So that's like sort of beating the purpose of using this app or like this device right?
    Because a lot of us use it because we don't want to be like pricking ourselves like so many times a day.
    So if a system like sort of requires you to keep doing that, which a lot of other brands, like a lot of other competitors of this particular brand requires you to do.
    Um it sort of beats about but this one is like already factory calibrated which means it's much more smarter and does not require you to do that.
    So I which also increases like in some sort of way, I don't know how it works in the background, but in a way it's also like much more accurate in terms of its reading compared to the other ones.
    So I think that's another thing that I really like about it.
    Um what I dislike about it is like I'm pretty sure like a lot of you have heard like a fire alarm noise that goes on on my phone in between.
    Yeah like so this is the app that like does, it's it's basically um alerts that my phone sends and it overrides my phone settings so I can't control like to silence my phone, it would override this silent mode.
    It's also because it's like sort of a medical emergency if it's deep.
    So it's like hey your sugar levels are dropping or your sugar levels are going high, so it means that I need to give more attention and like fix my readings.
    So I think the only thing that I dislike is like of course I understand like the the need for a lot but probably it could be like a little more subtle, like at least like the previous one that I was using, the noise is not so close to a fire alarm, right?
    Like I understand why like because fire alarm is not like a very prominent thing back in India, like of course we have fire alarms but they don't sound like this, but this brand being, you know, something that was founded in the United States, I feel like it should have like sort of thought about like what the noise also could um mean in other connotations because I don't mind the noise because I I know it's super important.
    I know like if I'm ever in a situation where I'm not feeling well, it should alert people around me to help me.
    Um but if people like sort of misunderstand that for like another emergency, like oh my God, there's a fire, look, I'm always paranoid when I'm like walking in my apartment corridor if it starts drinking, I don't want people to like run out of their homes and stuff, right?
    So I think and the sound also like gradually increases as as my sugar level drops.
    So like the louder it gets, the more um the more intense scared or like situation I am in which is create as a system that is the way it works.
    But I guess like the sound itself is something that could have worked on better.
    I see like I'm learning so many things right now, like it's so interesting.
    Like I was always wondering what does that, what does that sound mean?
    But I didn't know it was this that yeah, this is also interesting. I'm learning so much. Yeah.</div>
</div>



<div class="e6"> <img src="Group 12.png" > 
    <div class="hide6"> <div class="h6"> <h3>And so the next question is, do other interfaces work like this one?</h3></div> 
    <br> Um I would say like up to like 50%.
    Yes, like, like their competitors do work the same way, but I think like one major difference is what I was talking to you about like the calibration itself.
    Um and the other one, I think also like um it's I think the other other ones are also a little more um different in some ways, like a lot of them don't even connect to your phone.
    Um They have like another like another tiny little device that you have to carry, Like scan scan it or like um either or even if it comes on your phone, I guess like the visuals of the app itself is like a lot more dark in the sense.
    It's like black background with like with visuals like, like it has like the graphs on it, but this one actually, I feel like I should probably like share the interface with you because I'm talking so much about it.
    Um Yeah, so this is the interface. Oh, I see super clean and crisp.
    Yeah, so I think what's um what is different about this one is that I know like the hierarchy is like so like neat, right?
    So I think like it's not taking away like a lot from like what I need to be looking at.
    Um the other ones are not this way.
    Like I was saying it has like a black background, it has like the graph, this particular graph should like Um yeah, so this particular graph that you see here, that's like 3/4 of the screen.
    Yeah. And then it's also like they make it scroll this way on the other aps and this one you need to like tap on it and then it goes this way so you can toggle between different hours.
    Like for example, I need like this is currently showing 24 hours, but if I need like 16 hours or like four hours, three hours, like I can I can do that.
    So I just did it the other way around anyways, but it gives you the option of doing that and then like flipping back and like seeing it this way.
    So I think that's like the major difference in terms of like wishes and like the way that things are represented.
    Also like the this circle that you see here, right? Like this is I think that patented design.
    So this also has like a lot of connotations if the arrow is this way it means that my struggle level is steady and it's progressing in a legal manner.
    If it builds a little towards up or down by 45°, it means that it's slowly dropping.
    If it's like this like completely this is here.
    It means it's like going very high, like super fast, very low, super fast.
    And this also changes to like one arrow and two arrows.
    That also means that it's increasing um one at a time or two at a time.
    Like it's also determines the speed at which it's happening.
    So I think the other app sort of like just increase the number of arrows on the side of the number and like don't really indicate it, but this sort of like has like a more um, a more sorted out system, I would say.
    But I see. Yeah, like, like this is amazing.
    Like I'm learning so much like I like none of my families have diabetes.
    So like, I was not aware of this app at all, but like, I think this is like so helpful for sure to keep track on and like the arrow thing is like, like interesting.</div>

    .Blink2 {animation:blink 1s linear infinite}
        
    </style><h3 class="Blink1">Yeah. Um so number eight is how often do you use this interface</h3></div> 
    <br> <p class="blink2">I mean, I use this like all the time. Like, I think it's also like super important.
    Like um for us, like, like there are two types of diabetes, right?
    Like this type one and type two, Type two.
    Something that happens to be like older people for your um habits.
    Like if you have bad habits, like if you drink a lot, if you smoke a lot, if you have bad dietary habits, like if you eat a lot of junk food, um, you're obese, you tend to get type two in a much older age.
    Um Taipan is like, like I was saying it's totally autoimmune, it happens to Children.
    So when it happens to like Children of like really young age, right?
    Like I got it when I was seven years old, um it happens to Children much younger.
    Like there are three month old babies are like one year old babies getting it.
    So at this point it's like super hard like for us to um understand like what's happening in our body.
    So I think some systems like these are like so helpful because parents can like sort of track it for you.
    Like even if it's not you like tracking another great feature about this app because even though I have it on my phone, my parents also have it on their phone.
    So when my sugar is like fluctuating, they also get alerted saying that hey, like, so it also alerts the caregivers and everyone.
    So, um I think that like, because of that reason, like it's such a need, right?
    Like it's a need for us to be healthy.
    It's a need for us to make sure our sugar levels are in good range and for that reason I think I use it almost every time every day I eat, I use it like before I consume food, I use it like in between class.
    I like I have to like keep myself in check all the time.
    So I think every day, all the time it's how often I use it.</div>
</div>



<div class="e8"> <img src="Group 10.png" > 
    <div class="hide8"> <div class="h8"> <h3>Um, so if you have to change one thing in this interface, what would it be? </h3></div> 
    <br> Uh huh. Mm hmm. I think so.
    One thing about this interface is that it has two apps, right?
    So this is the first step and then they have another app to sort of create reports of your like data that it has collected.
    And then it tells you like how well you have been able to maintain for the last one month or like seven days or 10 days etcetera.
    Like how I showed you this one shows you trends for like up to 24 hours, That one shows you up like a month or like 60 days.
    So, um, what I would like is like maybe for it to also have that within this app.
    Like I know that might get super complicated but like if I want to have a quick glance I have to like go to a totally different data for that.
    So I don't know how convenient that is.</div>
</div>



<div class="e9"> <img src="Group 9.png" > 
    <div class="hide9"> <div class="h9"> <style type="text/css">
        @keyframes blink {

    .Blink1 {animation:blink 1s linear infinite}
    .Blink2 {animation:blink 1s linear infinite}
        
    </style><h3 class="Blink1">  How popular is this interface among the users and who are the target users?</h3></div> 
<br> <p class="blink2">Ah So the target users are like people with either type one or like type two who don't have great control.
Um I guess uh it is quite popular because like this particular brand is like super expensive right?
I'm able to get it for like I would say like it costs about $500 a month if you have no insurance.
Yeah I'm getting it like for $15 because of the student insurance.
Um But like otherwise it's like $500 and like that's also one of the reason why like people know about a lot about this interferes uh Like it's like one of these things that people want to have right like if you're if you're a type one and like um you know about tex calm just because how well it works and how expensive it is for you to like afford.
I think a lot of people, a lot of users are aware of it.
Um But I think it's also like if we like that was about this app in particular but if you just talk about like such systems in general I would say like in bigger countries like the United States a lot of like people are like more aware of such um autoimmune diseases.
So like when someone sees my C. G. M. On my hand they are aware like of what it is.
But like back in India like the the education about it is so less like I don't think a lot of people even know how to treat it with like basic things so forget about like such advanced technologies.
Like the knowledge about it is like super minimum. So I think that's the difference.
I think it depends a lot about like the culture and like like also like how well the country is progressing.</div>

<br> <p class="blink2"> Uh No I think I think um I totally like enjoy using this up.
Also like I was mentioning because I was using a different um before I think for me like this has been like super easy to use and also like weirdly it's like much cheaper for me like than the other one that I was using mainly because of the insurance.
So um yeah I love it like I think this is a great app if it comes in someone's afford since to really like be on a more healthy skin.
Yeah I see thank you so much for your response and yes. Very good.
Okay like stop recording so you can yes. Okay </div>
